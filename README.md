# Overview

This project explores a life expectancy data set with R. 

I had previously build a python GUI to provide queries for this dataset, and wanted to see how I could do similar activites with R.

In this project, I load the data, clean it, sort and filter, generate new rows based on adjoining years of data, and I also join the data set with historical data.

I present bar charts, pie charts, tables and data sets, and I do so using R markup.
